Some stuff about KCDC 2025.  Might make into a private repo later. 

[google sheet I use for picking sessions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tk0AT-HSIYNdE-MFE2kWEh85UY5l72C6gwHapDT_f5E/edit?usp=sharing).

[sessions.json](sessions.json) seems to be description of the talks at the KCDC.info 2025 conference.   Used browser to fetch it https://kcdc2025.sessionize.com/api/schedule
