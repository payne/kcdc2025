Slow load times and inefficient data handling can impact user experience and scalability, leading to frustrated users and higher infrastructure costs.\r\n\r\nIn this hands-on workshop, we will start with a Next.js application that lacks modern performance optimizations and gradually enhance it by implementing React Server Components (RSC) and Server Actions step by step. You will see how RSC reduces JavaScript bundle sizes, improves interactivity, and enables progressive rendering, while Server Actions make data updates more efficient by minimizing client-server communication.\r\n\r\nThrough guided demonstrations, we will transform the app from a traditional Next.js setup into an optimized, fast, and scalable application. By the end of the session, you will have a clear understanding of how to apply these techniques in your own projects to build faster, more responsive, and efficient Next.js applications.",

Behavior-driven Development (BDD) is a method that can achieve this by helping teams communicate better with their stakeholders and amongst each other regarding their delivery. Using the technique of Example Mapping, teams work with their PO to get to actionable scenarios and examples of the functionality they want to build. These examples become your tests, documentation, and the ultimate form of shifting left.\r\n\r\nWe will briefly discuss the background and principles of behavior-driven development and how to apply those. Soon into the workshop, the interaction will start in groups where we will look at the concepts of 'Rules' and 'Examples'. We will play with and practice Example Mapping, a technique that helps you break down and slice your user stories into practical scenarios. You will discover how these can be used directly as your tests and documentation for your team and a few different formats to apply these in. As the final takeaways, you'll learn how to facilitate better refinements with your teams to deliver optimal business value and complete your sprints with less rework and bugs.\r\n\r\nQuality at the start will facilitate quality in the rest of the process and with this workshop you will be leveling up your Shift Left approach with applicable skills.\r\n\r\nTakeaways:\r\nWhat Behavior-driven development (really) means and that it’s not the Gherkin you might have used before\r\nA practical application of use Example Mapping, a BDD technique, to discover requirements, test cases and hidden assumptions\r\nWays to address shift-left and BDD in your organisation\r\nTips to power-up your refinements to start with quality before your sprints start",

As we advance in our careers as software developers, we keep getting further and further away from the fundamentals. That’s a shame because the fundamentals are useful in our day jobs, appear often as technical interview questions, and honestly they’re also really fun to poke at. It’s right there in the name! \r\n\r\nThis workshop is a refresher, or crash course, on the basic data structures and algorithms that underpin the software we build.  We’ll focus on techniques for recognizing the structure of a problem, finding a relevant data structure to help solve it, and ballparking the cost of computing answers in terms of time and memory.

      "description": "Most web and mobile apps benefit from being \"reactive\": if something changes in the backend, they can immediately show it in every connected frontend, without a page refresh. Reactivity is especially important if your app is \"multiplayer\": with multiple humans or agentic AIs interacting with each other via your backend - like chatrooms, dashboards, or collaborative editing, for example.\r\n\r\nBuilding a reactive, multiplayer app with Python has been pretty complicated though. Hurdles include:\r\n\r\n* How do you send events from the backend to the frontend (probably written in JavaScript)?\r\n\r\n* How does your backend even know that there's events to send, especially if your app gets big enough to need multiple servers?\r\n\r\n* How do you manage and safely change the state shared between frontends, ideally without writing yet more JavaScript?\r\n\r\n* How do you safely serialize/deserialize Python objects for clients that may be running old code (backwards compatibility), while also keeping type safety?\r\n\r\n* How can reactive APIs work if you also have clients that aren't JavaScript, for example other Python programs?\r\n\r\nThis workshop will use reboot.dev to show you how to build these reactive, multiplayer apps!",

We google, form theories and test against what little information is provided in the challenge.\r\n\r\nYou don't need any prior knowledge of a specific programming language. Rather, we focus on developing the skills needed to participate in a Capture the Flag event.\r\n\r\nAfter an introduction to Capture the Flag events, we dig into two challenges. These are real challenges from past CTF events.\r\n\r\nFor each challenge, we follow a pattern of discovery:\r\n\r\n1. Introduce the challenge\r\n2. Review clues from the challenge text and challenge interface\r\n3. Give participants time to take on the challenge\r\n4. Pause and review progress and give a hint\r\n5. Give participants more time to solve the challenge\r\n6. Review the solution and lessons learned",

We’ll dive into Conway’s Law, which explains how software systems mirror the communication patterns within an organization and look at Inverse Conway Maneuvers to see how reorganizing teams can help align architecture with business goals. To ignore Conway’s law is a trap that will lead to software that is more expensive, and less effective, especially in the micro-services and composable era.  We’ll also examine Team Topologies, focusing on how different team types and interaction modes reduce complexity, improve collaboration, and speed up delivery. \r\n\r\nReal-world examples will demonstrate how intentional organizational design can eliminate silos and enhance product quality by keeping your codebase closely tied to the customer experience and broader business objectives.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways: \r\n• Understand how Conway’s Law reveals the link between organizational silos and siloed software.\u2028• Apply Inverse Conway Maneuvers to create team structures that support more adaptive architectures.\u2028• Explore Team Topologies and learn how specific team roles and interaction patterns reduce complexity.\u2028• Gain practical ideas for rolling out these changes, managing culture shifts, and measuring success.\r\n",

Your carefully crafted privacy protections, designed to withstand traditional analysis, are about to face a wave of AI-powered pattern recognition that puts sophisticated privacy-breaking capabilities into everyone's hands.\r\n\r\nThrough live demonstrations, you'll watch as simple AI tools reconstruct user identities from \"anonymous\" chat data, rebuild social networks from encrypted messages, and expose organizational structures from metadata we thought was safe. What once required deep expertise in statistical analysis can now be done with a few prompts to an LLM.\r\n\r\nWe'll explore how traditional privacy approaches fail against these democratized threats, and examine modern defenses like differential privacy and federated learning. You'll leave understanding both the scale of this new challenge and practical steps to protect your systems. Whether you're building communication tools, handling sensitive data, or protecting user privacy, this talk will show you why yesterday's privacy tools won't survive in a world where sophisticated pattern analysis is available to all.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways:\r\n- How traditional privacy and anonymization tools fail against basic AI analysis\r\n- Understanding the new ways AI can reconstruct identities and relationships\r\n- Practical architectures and techniques for building AI-resistant privacy systems",

      "description": "When we talk about CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery), it's like the classic combo of peanut butter and jelly. But here's the catch: CI deals with building stuff, while CD is all about getting it out there. Let's break down what the \"D\" in CI/CD really means because a lot of us tend to focus only on the \"CI\" part.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll guide you through the world of Continuous Delivery (CD) and cover crucial aspects, including Rollback Strategies, Feature Toggles, Automated Testing, Infrastructure as Code, and Monitoring and Observability. Join me as we unravel the mystery behind Continuous Delivery, making it accessible and insightful for developers.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you’ll walk away with practical insights and actionable takeaways to embrace Continuous Delivery as a core DevOps practice, making deployments faster, safer, and stress-free.",

      "description": "Modern web applications demand a robust end-to-end (E2E) testing strategy to ensure reliability, scalability, and seamless user experiences. Cypress has become a favorite among developers due to its speed, ease of use, and powerful debugging capabilities. However, as applications grow, so do the challenges in writing and maintaining efficient test suites. Flaky tests, slow execution times, and unreliable test environments can quickly become bottlenecks in a development workflow.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores how to scale Cypress effectively in modern web applications. We’ll dive into best practices for structuring test suites, handling flaky tests, and leveraging API stubbing for fast, reliable tests. Authentication, network requests, and session management can often introduce complexity in testing workflows. We will learn practical approaches to managing these challenges with Cypress’s built-in tools.\r\n\r\nBeyond writing tests, we will also discuss strategies for running Cypress in CI/CD pipelines, optimizing test execution times, and parallelizing tests for improved efficiency. Whether you are testing a React, Vue, Angular, or traditional server-rendered application, this session will provide actionable insights on making Cypress a seamless part of your development and deployment process. Through real-world examples and live demonstrations, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to build scalable, maintainable test automation with Cypress.\r\n",

      "description": "This talk describes building web applications focused on hypermedia, an approach that differs significantly from the SPA frameworks popular today such as React and Angular.\r\n\r\nToday, web apps typically use client-side JavaScript code to send HTTP requests to server endpoints that query/update databases and return JSON data. The client code then transforms JSON into an HTML presentation.\r\n\r\nThis is not what Roy Fielding had in mind when he wrote his famous dissertation \"Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures\" that gave birth to REST.\r\n\r\nHTMX is a small client-side JavaScript library that adds support for new HTML attributes. These enable responding to specific interactions (ex. click) with any HTML element by sending an HTTP request using any verb. The response must contain HTML. Rather than performing a complete page refresh, the returned HTML replaces an existing DOM element or is inserted relative to one.\r\n\r\nThis approach removes the need to serialize data to JSON on the server, parse JSON on the client, and convert it to HTML. It also simplifies state management because all state can reside only on the server.\r\n\r\nThe server can be implemented using any programming language and server framework. While HTMX itself is implemented in JavaScript, HTMX enables writing complete web applications without authoring any JavaScript code.\r\n\r\nTopics covered will include:\r\n\r\n- Introduction to htmx\r\n- Choosing a tech stack\r\n- Example htmx app\r\n- Pros and cons\r\n- Frequently used htmx attributes\r\n- Out-of-band swaps\r\n- Input validation\r\n- Lazy loading\r\n- Active search\r\n- Infinite scroll\r\n- Alpine\r\n- Resources",

Effective and seamless cooperation between many teams is necessary to deliver the experiences that today's consumers expect. Yet the agile development model optimizes processes around the work of a single team. How can engineers and teams work together effectively across team boundaries?\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the practice of InnerSource has risen as a methodology for facilitating cross-team collaboration across the company. InnerSource is the application of open source project management and work strategies applied to company-internal software. An InnerSource mindset treats all software inside the organization as free and open for anyone to use and contribute, much the same way as open source outside the company.\r\n\r\nSuccessful adoption of InnerSource is an intentional process that, if done right, unlocks greater engineering efficiencies, increased innovation, a more empowering developer environment, and easier participation in open source. In this talk, we give an explanation of InnerSource, specific examples of its adoption in various companies and industries, anecdotes and data on the value it gives, and tips, tricks, and gotchas for introducing it into your company.",

After all, am I the only one around here who wants to avoid [Angry Walter](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/am-i-the-only-one-around-here)? And who *wouldn't* want to work with  [Success Kid](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/success-kid-i-hate-sandcastles).\r\n\r\nBut can we even find out if we have a meme twin? There are lots of memes. And lots of people. How could we possibly search them all? Well, it's easier than you think if we turn those memes into embeddings and search them with a vector database!\r\n\r\nBut what's an embedding? And what's a vector database? Well, that's what I'll cover in this session. I'll begin by exploring embeddings, showing how unstructured data, such as text and images, can be translated into hyper-dimensional arrays—called vectors—using both common and custom AI models. Then I'll talk about vector databases, covering what they are and how you can use them to store and search those embeddings with embeddings of your own.\r\n\r\nOf course, we'll do this all by example. I've turned all the big memes—from [Ancient Aliens Guy](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ancient-aliens) to [Zombie Boy](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/184608242/zombie-boy)—into embeddings and have loaded them into a vector database. I've built an application around these embeddings and that database. I'll show you the code and the queries of this application so that you can build something similar for yourself. And, most importantly, we'll take some photos during the session and use it all to find your meme twin!\r\n\r\nSo, are you ready to find your meme twin? Or are you ready to learn how to use this technology? I say, [Why Not Both](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/why-not-both-why-dont-we-have-both).",

Meanwhile, developers and practitioners are job-hopping more than ever. \r\nThis talk will explore the origins and evolution of \"developer experience,\" dissect popular frameworks, and advocate for a more balanced approach that values the practitioner's perspective.

Modern apps demand solid UX powered by beautiful UI and React developers should not be reinventing the UI wheel. Quintessential React libraries like KendoReact Free can help — a collection of well-engineered UI components available on NPM for free, with professionally designed dynamic themes and VS Code Extension for productivity. \r\n\r\nGood user experience begins with design and AI-powered tools can assist with dynamic styling of web apps towards consistent UI. Modern AI provides an opportunity to streamline and automate developer workflows for better productivity – AI Models have gotten very good with React development and AI Agents can be provided contextual tools with Model Context Protocol (MCP). Throw in some AI goodness as GitHub Copilot Extension or MCP Tools - and developers have everything to supercharge frontend development.\r\n\r\nMany traditional .NET shops now do React in the frontend, and modern .NET WebAPI as backend, with support for OpenAPI for building API endpoints over data. But what if there is a need to see React apps working on mobile/desktop form factors? Armed with modern smart WebViews, .NET MAUI is more than capable of welcoming web content to native land. In fact, Blazor/React developers should feel empowered to bring web UI components, routing and styling to native cross-platform apps, while gaining complete platform API access. \r\n\r\nTurns out, .NET & React make for a great mixed tech stack and AI helps with productivity – good for developer flexibility.",

      "description": "Organizations are resistant to change, but it may not be for the reasons you think. When it comes to modernizing an application, navigating corporate bureaucracy is often the largest hurdle. Coordinating across multiple departments can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Dev teams often get stuck in a cycle of “hurry up and wait”.\r\n\r\nMost talks about modernization talk about the strangler fig pattern. In this session, we will go beyond strangler fig to discuss how you can leverage technical solutions to subtly but effectively overcome bureaucratic challenges.\r\n\r\nBy empowering your team to move the ball forward, get things done, and achieve as much progress as possible independently, you will have happier developers and happier stakeholders.",

Real-time data without custom training. \r\n\r\nGartner predicts that by 2026, more than 30% of the increase in demand for APIs will come from artificial intelligence and tools using large language models. API sprawl is a hazardous form of technical debt. It has hard costs from hosting and scaling a fleet of APIs, real security risks and an increased operational burden from the sheer number of APIs that platform engineering teams need to manage. With GraphQL, any client, even an LLM, can request exactly the data they need without over or under-fetching. And with federated GraphQL, the data can come from any underlying API.\r\n\r\nLearn popular use cases for implementing the graph in an AI-driven experience, how organizations can safely adopt AI on a spectrum from low to high trust, and why GraphQL shines as an ideal API orchestration layer for AI.",

      "description": "This is the case study of how we changed how we ship software. \r\n\r\nWith thousands of customers, each in their own Kubernetes container, deploying updates was tough. Off-hours schedules meant it took over 24 hours to push a new version. If something broke, we had to scramble. Using a Canary-based approach, we could update small groups of customers at a time. We built a tool to stop rollouts fast when issues appeared, limiting the damage.\r\n\r\nIn the past, new features went to everyone at once. Rolling back wasn't an option.  If something failed, it'd leave customers stuck in the mess. Now, using OpenFeature, we hide new functionality behind feature flags. We release features to small groups, gather feedback, and test internally for weeks. If things go wrong, we flip the flag off and move on.\r\n\r\nThis two-pronged approach lets us avoid risky big-bang releases. We went from deploying every 10 days to every 4, with fewer than 1% high-severity defects.  Most of these are resolved before customers notice them.",

How do you ensure that what you're building today doesn't become tomorrow's technical debt? Are you even qualified to make these decisions?\r\n\r\nWell, someone thought I was. In this talk, we anticipate some challenges we might run into when taking on these types of tasks by analyzing the traits and behaviors of software architects and how they can influence a team's ability to implement a solution. The strategies of good architects — such as balancing their level of control over a team, explaining and negotiating the trade-offs of a particular path, and being able to see just enough into the future to avoid overengineering — are likely already present in the thought patterns you possess from being an individual contributor.\r\n\r\nWhether you aim to grow into an architect role or want to make better choices as you develop code, this talk will give you the tools to bridge the gap between writing software and shaping systems. Are you up to the task? Join me, and you'll find out.",

In this presentation, we are going to examine the craft of communicating via prose. Because, like it or not, your career demands and depends on it.

In my team’s unique experience, this outside force was a global pandemic.  In April of 2020, our Kansas City lab’s legacy software could not scale to handle the unique needs to provide mass Covid testing, so we developed our own.  Throughout this venture, we were constantly presented with timelines that were wildly unattainable, and development was constantly in a race against time.  In this discussion, I’ll step through strategies we utilized during this Crisis Coding which were successful.  Our lab would go on to perform nearly one million Covid tests utilizing our solution, and supported testing for local hospitals, businesses, school districts, and mass test sites.\r\nNow that the pandemic has passed, the impossible deadlines never seem to have subsided, but the lessons learned throughout our experience can be helpful to anyone dealing with unrealistic timelines.\r\n",

      "description": "- Short Summary\r\nAchieving predictable Agile delivery is a challenge—traditional planning methods relying on velocity and gut-feel estimates often fall short.\r\n\r\nThis hands-on, interactive workshop introduces three powerful, data-driven forecasting techniques:\r\n\r\n* Evidence-Based Management (EBM) – Aligning Agile delivery with business outcomes.\r\n* Monte Carlo Forecasting – Replacing unreliable estimates with probabilistic forecasting that stakeholders can trust.\r\n* Flow Metrics – Using Work In Progress (WIP), Cycle Time, and Throughput to optimize team efficiency and eliminate bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nThrough custom dice-based simulations and real-world scenarios, participants will shift from deterministic deadlines to probabilistic decision-making, gaining practical techniques to improve forecasting, stakeholder alignment, and delivery confidence.\r\n\r\n- Full Session Description / Abstract\r\nWhy do so many Agile teams struggle with predictability?\r\nBecause they rely on outdated planning techniques that don’t reflect real-world variability. Velocity-based forecasts fail under uncertainty, leading to missed expectations, reactive decision-making, and frustrated stakeholders.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, participants will learn and apply modern forecasting and flow techniques that turn uncertainty into actionable, data-driven insights. Through interactive simulations and hands-on exercises, attendees will discover how to use Monte Carlo Forecasting, EBM, and Flow Metrics to improve delivery planning and optimize team performance.\r\n\r\nWhat You’ll Experience\r\nIntroduction – Why Traditional Agile Planning Fails\r\n* Common challenges in Agile forecasting and planning.\r\n* The Triforce of Predictable Delivery: Monte Carlo Forecasting, EBM, and Flow Metrics.\r\n\r\nMonte Carlo Forecasting: Simulating Reality for Smarter Decisions\r\n* Hands-on Dice-Based Forecasting Exercise – Participants simulate delivery variability using digital dice tools (or physical dice at home), recording results in a shared worksheet.\r\n* Shifting Mindsets – Moving from deterministic deadlines to probabilistic, confidence-based delivery conversations.\r\n* Visualizing Forecasts – Using sticky notes, participants compare deterministic vs. probabilistic predictions. \r\n\r\nEvidence-Based Management (EBM) & The Hidden Impact of Defects\r\n* Defect Simulation – Participants use digital dice to model how emergent work and production incidents disrupt delivery.\r\n* Key Value Areas (KVAs) – Understanding Technical Debt, Production Incidents, and Innovation Rate to drive better decisions.\r\n\r\nFlow Metrics & Aging WIP: Improving Team Efficiency\r\n* Understanding Work In Progress (WIP), Cycle Time, and Throughput – and how they impact flow.\r\n* Interactive Bottleneck Mapping – Participants visualize aging WIP and simulate queueing theory principles.\r\n* “Stop Starting, Start Finishing” – How to apply WIP limits and optimize flow for faster, more predictable delivery.\r\n\r\nWrap-Up & Action Planning\r\n* Creating Personalized Action Plans – How to apply these techniques with real stakeholders and teams.\r\n* Live Group Discussion & Q&A – Ensuring participants leave with confidence and actionable insights.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways\r\n* Replace unreliable velocity-based planning with probabilistic forecasting that stakeholders can trust.\r\n* Simulate real-world unpredictability using Monte Carlo techniques—developing confidence intervals for delivery.\r\n* Understand how escape defects and emergent work disrupt delivery—and how to mitigate their impact.\r\n* Use Flow Metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimize efficiency, reducing time spent on in-progress work.\r\n* Shift the conversation with leadership—move from gut-feel estimates to data-driven decision-making.",

      "description": "Elevator Pitch\r\n---\r\nUsability is the gateway to a product's success—it’s the first thing users interact with, and it shapes their impression within seconds. A poor user experience can lead to immediate abandonment, like uninstalling an app that feels clunky or confusing. But how can we ensure great usability? In this talk, let’s explore key principles and practical strategies to create user-friendly designs that captivate and retain your audience. \r\n\r\nProblem Statement\r\n---\r\nProduct Quality is traditionally linked to functional correctness, ensuring that a product works as intended. However, usability—a critical aspect of quality that directly impacts user experience—is often underrated or overlooked. While functionality ensures a product’s capability, poor usability can render those functions irrelevant if users find the application confusing, frustrating, or difficult to navigate. In some cases, usability is even more important than functionality; after all, a perfectly functioning feature is meaningless if users cannot or will not use it. The key aspects of a usability are important for everyone: Designers, Developers and Testers.\r\n\r\nProposal\r\n---\r\nI will go over practical examples from my actual projects for each usability aspect. \r\n\r\n* Stability: Deliver consistent, reliable performance.\r\n* Lean Design: Eliminate unnecessary complexity.\r\n* Clarity: Create intuitive and easily understandable interfaces.\r\n* Simplicity: Simplify workflows and reduce cognitive load.\r\n* User Expectations: Align with industry standards and user needs.\r\n* Error Handling: Provide meaningful feedback and recovery options.\r\n* Accessibility: Ensure inclusivity for diverse users and needs.\r\n\r\nBy sharing real-life examples, we will discuss not only good usability practices, but also ways to broaden the horizons of quality assurance. When I was working as a QA engineer on a project, after discussing with the Product Owner, we successfully removed some unnecessary pages from the web app, reducing the need to maintain several test cases. This was a strong demonstration of the initiatives QA professionals can take beyond simply running test cases to improve efficiency.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways\r\n---\r\n* Recognition of usability as a critical aspect of product success\r\n* Application of principles like stability, lean design, clarity, simplicity, user expectations, error handling, and accessibility\r\n* Collaboration across teams to embed usability throughout the development process,\r\n* Driving efficiency by removing unnecessary features,\r\n* Taking proactive initiative to propose usability improvements that enhance user satisfaction and product quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Interfaces have changed over the years, and many the changes were not well publicized -- including default implementation, member access modifiers, and static members. The Microsoft documentation is correct, but many other C# resources have outdated information. So let's look at these features and see where they are useful and where they should be avoided. With some practical tips, \"gotchas\", and plenty of examples, we'll see how to use these features effectively (and safely) in our code.",

      "description": "This session offers a hands-on, security-focused look at how to implement and scale authorization for MCP servers using modern OAuth 2.1 best practices. As more teams adopt the Model Context Protocol to enable AI agents, developer tools, and orchestration systems to interact with external APIs, securing those interactions becomes critical—especially in enterprise settings where multi-tenancy, scoped access, and separation of concerns are non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nWe’ll walk through how to structure your MCP server to enforce fine-grained authorization across different tool calls, ensuring that every request is evaluated against issued scopes and contextual access rules. You’ll learn how to integrate external identity providers and authorization servers cleanly into the flow—delegating token issuance, validation, and client trust establishment without complicating the core execution logic of your server, as per the latest authorization specification.\r\n\r\nA key theme in the session is addressing the gap in how MCP clients behave today. Most implementations fail to follow a progressive scoping model—often requesting all possible access during dynamic registration or initial configuration. We’ll explore strategies for guiding clients toward least-privilege access, supporting incremental scope requests, and handling re-consent or step-up flows when more access is needed.\r\n\r\nThe session will also cover practical implementation patterns: validating tokens and scopes, handling different client types (human vs. agent), mapping scopes to tool capabilities, and managing policy enforcement at both the tenant and action level. You’ll come away with architecture guidance and working models that you can adapt to your environment.\r\n\r\nThis talk is designed for developers, platform engineers, and security architects building or integrating with MCP-based systems. If you’re looking to make your MCP deployment secure, scalable, and ready for production—this session will show you how.",

      "description": "At a developer conference in New York, I discovered something unexpected. The leading developers weren't just experimenting with AI, they were truly collaborating with it. This was my turning point. I'd been hiding my own AI usage, afraid it would expose me as the impostor I always feared I was. But that fear transformed into curiosity: could embracing AI actually make me a better developer?\r\nWhat followed was a journey of professional reinvention. Instead of seeing AI as a threat or a crutch, I learned to treat different AI models as members of my development team, each with their own strengths and working styles. This mindset shift helped me grow from a developer comfortable in two languages to someone confidently working across seven, guiding AI collaborators rather than fighting my tools or feeling guilty about using them.\r\nThis new approach to professional growth helped me tackle challenges I never thought possible. When tasked with creating a Laravel starter kit, despite minimal PHP experience, I drew on my AI collaboration techniques to produce work that earned approval from Laravel's creator himself. The key wasn't just using AI tools - it was learning to orchestrate discussions, maintain context, and most importantly, stay in control of the development process.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn:\r\n\r\n- How to overcome impostor syndrome around AI usage in development\r\n- Techniques for growing your capabilities by treating AI as team members\r\n- Strategies for maintaining agency and understanding while leveraging AI\r\n- Methods for expanding your technical range through thoughtful AI collaboration\r\n\r\nBecause ultimately, this isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about growing as a developer by thoughtfully embracing new ways of working.",

Should you throw it all out and start over? That approach can be even more expensive. The answer is nuanced: it depends.\r\n\r\nIt depends on the specific needs of the business: does it need to scale? What about safety or privacy? How about performance? What technology stacks are already in use at the customer? Is that important to them? Architectural decisions and trade-offs must be made.\r\n\r\nAs an application modernization architect, I have led numerous projects to update legacy systems. In this session, I will share my experiences and the strategies I use to navigate these challenges. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the session, you will have a clear understanding of where to start and the steps to take to bring your business-critical applications into the modern age.",

Perhaps you’ve been thinking about learning it, but the thought of having to do another set of “Hello World” style exercises is filling you with dread. Is there a more fun way to get up to speed with Python?\r\n\r\nYes, there is, and it’s called Ren’Py. It’s billed as a visual novel engine and often used for writing dating simulation games, but it’s so much more than that. It’s a platform that lets you code in Python (and more) and deploy to desktop, web, and even mobile platforms, and with a fraction of the effort required by React, Vue, or Angular. It’s a fun framework that’s been used to produce games you can find on Steam, but it’s got applications well beyond amusement.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll look not just at the basics of Ren’Py development, but the building of a dating game based on KFC’s official game, “I Love You Colonel Sanders,” a simple turn-based combat game starring Florida Man, and building mobile apps in a way that’s less frustrating than usual.",

Everything was greenfield and productivity couldn't be higher. Until the production switch flipped and nothing worked in a proper distributed environment.\r\n\r\nSomething went horribly awry in our microservice megadisaster, but monoliths can ease the pain by removing the distributed nature of our system. However, we don't want to repeat our mistakes of creating a big ball of mud, or a big ball of distributed mud. Enter the modular monolith, an architecture that preserves the beneficial aspects of a single application and the advantages of isolated areas of data and behavior.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll look at the various patterns of modularizing a monolith. We'll answer such questions as \"what even is a Module?\", how to draw module boundaries, and evolutionary design techniques to migrate an existing monolith. Finally, we'll look at techniques to extract modules into services, giving the best possible chance for a microservice architecture to thrive.",

Many developers are familiar with the massive potential bloat of the 'node_modules' folder, how nightmarish it can be managing your Python paths & environments, or how difficult it is to test or run any given software locally. Need to store some relational data? “Well, I better fire up a full-fat Postgres deployment!” And none of this even touches on \"dependency hell\". Yikes.\r\n\r\nMany developers often forget (or in my experience, simply don’t know) that for the most common tasks on UNIX-alike systems, there’s likely already command-line software installed to do the job! The GNU Project collectively provides nearly four hundred pieces of software to solve common (and not-so-common) computational problems. Outside of the GNU ecosystem, there are plenty of small-footprint, low- or no-dependency software packages available through a package manager or direct install to solve any straggling issues you may have.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will demonstrate how to resolve some of the most common or frustrating tasks developers might face using a sample of these tools: local databases; data preprocessing; JSON parsing & filtering; parallelization; task orchestration; interacting with REST APIs & remote files; and more!",

But when we don’t understand that code, we can all too often dismiss, disparage, or even simply delete it - and that’s a mistake! \r\n\r\nAlmost all the code we interact with was written by other humans, and they wrote the code that way for a reason. If we take the time to understand the context and the story behind a piece of code, we can infer a lot about what those humans meant to achieve, what their culture was like, and what they valued… in other words, we need to become an archaeologist!\r\n\r\nLet’s work to build a better understanding of the code we didn’t write, and of who wrote it and why. Using the tools of psychology you can learn what’s happening to your brain when you’re reading someone else’s code, and then learn how you can make understanding it take less cognitive effort. Using the tools of archaeology you can learn how to use your development environment to find the real stories of the people that wrote it, and how that story can protect you from making the same mistakes they did. The ability to read and examine others’ code is essential - you can’t change or improve software without understanding what it already does, so come learn how to do it with skill and compassion!",

Figuring out what to protect and how much effort we will spend on that protection is half the battle. The other half is understanding what happens if we fail- what it costs us and how it impacts us. \r\nBut the art of threat modeling isn’t just for securing software. Imagine we are security consultants for a medieval kingdom. We will determine the castle’s weak points by planning an attack. We will learn to assess risks by asking what the stronghold, well, um, holds. And we will strengthen our defenses by applying limited resources in the places that will help us the most. By the time we are through, our fortress will be sturdier, we will be able to stave off attacks, and we’ll know what improvements we can make to keep the kingdom safe.\r\nFinally, we will discuss how it applies to development projects and how we can use these techniques to secure software.

As models advance seemingly overnight, our ability to interpret their decisions struggles to keep pace. The field of Interpretability isn’t just about explaining outputs or offering post-hoc reasoning— it’s about uncovering how these models actually process and represent information. \r\n\r\nThis talk explores the latest research shaping AI Interpretability, from Anthropic’s 2024 work on mechanistic interpretability and monosemanticity scaling, to methodologies that have historically aimed at explaining models but fall short for today’s LLMs. We’ll clarify the distinction between explainability and interpretability, their respective use cases, and the current toolkit for understanding black-box models. Along the way, we’ll debunk common myths (like the tendency to anthropomorphize LLMs), and discuss why interpretable AI is essential for both reliability and trust. \r\n\r\nFor engineers at all levels– whether integrating LLMs into applications or advancing AI research– interpretability is no longer optional. It’s necessary for debugging unexpected model behavior, improving efficiency, and ensuring AI systems remain adaptable and aligned with human goals. If we don’t keep up, we risk being outpaced by models we barely understand, yet still utilize. Attendees will leave with a clearer framework for assessing LLM behavior and practical strategies for applying interpretability techniques to real-world AI systems. ",

He has baked bagels, guarded Clint Black’s town home, cooked for a gourmet food shop, freed stuck college students from elevators, managed printing plates for packaging, and served as a linguist in the Air Force. He taught himself HTML when the Netscape browser was still a thing, and the rest is history.\r\n\r\nPhil is a twenty-year veteran of the software development industry in the Kansas City area. If you’re in the Kansas City area, he is two degrees of separation away from any programmer you know and has probably worked for, at, or with your company.\r\n\r\nWhen the agile movement hit town, Phil knew a good thing when he saw it and became an early adopter of first wave agile practices. He has used these practices to ideate, build, and complete software projects ranging from loan forecasting to routing irrigation trucks to managing pharmacies to predictive lead generation to selling teddy bears. When people ask what vertical his company serves, he says, “Yours.”\r\n\r\nPhil has incorporated Lean methodologies into software development just like his father used to do in manufacturing. When he partnered with Travis Dietz to start Integrity Inspired Solutions in 2012, they laid the foundation in Lean to make the custom software development enterprise more humane, predictable, and focused on the success of everyone involved.\r\n\r\nA regular speaker at developer, Lean, and Agile conferences, Phil has a passion for taking his company’s ways to other companies whether they create software or not. He loves to see them transform from a collection of interactions riddled with disappointments and broken promises to team-oriented relational companies enjoying newfound trust, joy, efficiency, and success. Several companies from all over the world in all different industries contract Phil to help coach them through their own journeys.  He also hosts the successful \"Agile Bites\" podcast.\r\n\r\nWhen he’s not helping project managers learn predictive metrics or helping developers write customer-focused features, he’s enjoying a wide array of highly geeky hobbies including fantasy and sci-fi novels, gaming, and teaching Filipino stick fighting. His main hobby is making the world a better place for everyone who has to share the planet with him, and the engine for that is love.",
